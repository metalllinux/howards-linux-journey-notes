# Adding New Users to a Linux System

## Introduction

This is a basic tutorial on how to create new users on a Linux system.

## Prerequisites

* A bare metal machine or VM running Linux.
* Access to a `root` user or a user with privilege escalation.

## Add a new user

* Log in either as the `root` user or a user with privilege escalation.
* Add the new user:
```
useradd -m <USERNAME>
```
* The `-m` flag creates a `/home/<USERNAME>` directory for the user, which the majority of users will require.

## Setting a password

* Provide the new user a password:
```
passwd <USERNAME>
```
* You can attempt to login with the new user's password, to ensure it was set correctly:
```
su - <USERNAME>
```

## Add the user to the wheel group for privilege escalation

* Add the user to the `wheel` group (standard group for most distributions), so they can run commands with `sudo`:
```
usermod -aG wheel <USERNAME>
```

## Check the shadow file for the created user

* To ensure the user was created correctly, check the `/etc/shadow` file:
```
grep <USERNAME> /etc/shadow
```

## Conclusion

The above has shown you how to add a new user, as well as set them up with a password and adding them to the `wheel` group for privilege escalation.
