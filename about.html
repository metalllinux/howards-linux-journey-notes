# About Me

* My name is Howard and I love Linux and open source software. In my opinion, Linux and the wider open source movement are two of the best collaborative efforts in the history of humanity.
* I work as a Customer Support Engineer and absolutely love my job - it is very satisfying to solve customer issues using Linux and open source software and to give back to the community.
